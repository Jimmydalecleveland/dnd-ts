# DND Mimic in Typescript

This is a for fun/practice side project. The goal is to have a character creation app for D&D. We'll see where it goes from there. This is a rewrite (starting from scratch) of an older project because I wanted to learn Typescript and some other tools. The database isn't hosted anywhere so it won't run locally for anyone but me currently.

Early concept examples. Very rough but a starting point.

This last one is just to show the character saved in the database from the previous screens choices. This part of the UI is undergoing a lot of design work currently.
